My Current Mantra: Keep Coding & Carry On Coding


# Remote Developer Experience:  
>Firstly, I enrolled in a Web Development Experience program from [Green Rock Consulting](https://www.greenrockconsulting.co.uk/index.php). They provided me an opportunity to work with a Web and Mobile app development company called [Bune Bear](http://bunebear.com). A senior Web developer alloted me number of tasks over the period of three months which I completed successfully. This is the first time, I attempted to learn Back-end development that too remotely under a Senior Web Developer Supervision.

>Secondly, I am involved in two successful Chingu voyages with each Voyage lasted for 6 weeks. [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) is a global collaboration platform and coding-cohort generator. Participants build a project in a remote team and level-up with the technical and soft skills required in a professional software job.

* I Built a simple Google Fonts clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as a solo project for entry to Chingu.

* On my first voyage, Collaborated with an international four-person team to build a fully functional clone of the Fortnite landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an emphasis on mobile-first responsiveness. Here is the Project Link [Fortnite](https://fortniteclone.netlify.com/).

* On my second voyage, Collaborated with an international two-person team to build a fully functional clone of the Giphy landing page using HTML, CSS, and API functionality. Here is the Project Link [Giphy](https://chingu-voyages.github.io/v15-geckos-team-03/index.html).
</p> 
 
* In both voyages, I took part in weekly audio call team meetings, daily conversations, and pair programming to solve problems, co-ordinate code, and plan improvements.

> In addition to the above remote developer experience, I have a solid educational foundation with a Computer Science Engineering degree and Post Graduate Diploma in Management studies. I offer multiple relevant technical and interpersonal skills. For instance, I'm able to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Node, Express, PHP, SQL, Command line and Git, etc. at a comfortable level. I am an excellent team player with strong attention to detail and accuracy and also had an important ability to work and perform well under pressure.

>I maintain projects on my GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com/sasigit7"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23181717.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white"/></a> and regularly logs my coding journey on 
<a href="https://twitter.com/ShashiWebDev"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/twitter-%231DA1F2.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=twitter&logoColor=white"/></a> and on professional network <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashi-m-0a3b8244/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white"/></a>. 
On top of that, not a day goes by without me thinking about web development, reading web dev blogs, and coding something as I am very passionate about it. I continuously striving to improve my coding skills and try to bring my ideas to life and help others see what I think a better world looks like. I firmly believe these skills will immensely help me personally as well as professionally. Personally, they enhance my intellect, broaden my thought process and open my mind for tackling complex issues. Professionally, this will be a rewarding career because web development is something that is never going to become extinct, and it is undoubtedly going to rise higher and higher.
