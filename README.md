I offer multiple relevant technical and interpersonal skills. For instance, I'm able to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, React, PHP, SQL, Command line and Git, etc. in my projects. I am an excellent team player with strong attention to detail and accuracy and also had an important ability to work and perform well under pressure.

On top of that, not a day goes by without me thinking about web development, reading web dev blogs, and coding something as I am very passionate about it. I continuously striving to improve my coding skills and try to bring my ideas to life and help others see what I think a better world looks like. I firmly believe these skills will immensely help me personally as well as professionally.

Professionally, this will be a rewarding career because web development is something that is never going to become extinct, and it is undoubtedly going to rise higher and higher.
